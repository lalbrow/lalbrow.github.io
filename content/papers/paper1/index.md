description: "In a short MeerKAT observation, astronomers unexpectedly found 49 hydrogen-rich galaxies—some interacting in groups—revealing hidden structures and highlighting the telescope’s power to uncover the unseen universe." 
summary: "In just 2.3 hours of telescope time, my supervisor used MeerKAT to discover 49 galaxies rich in hydrogen gas, some of which appear to be interacting as part of larger galaxy groups. By combining radio and optical data, we explored their structures, star formation, and dark matter—showcasing MeerKAT’s exciting potential to uncover hidden galaxies in the universe."

##### Abstract

We report on the serendipitous discovery of 49 HI-rich galaxies in a 2.3 h Open Time observation with MeerKAT. We present their properties including their HI masses, intensity and velocity maps, and spectra. We determine that at least three HI-rich galaxy groups have been detected, potentially as part of a supergroup. Some members of these galaxy groups show clear interaction with each other in their HI emission. We cross-match the detections with PanSTARRS, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, and Galaxy Evolution Explorer, and obtain stellar masses and star formation rates. One source is found to be a potential OH megamaser, but further follow-up is required to confidently determine this. For six sources with sufficient spatial resolution in HI, we produce rotation curves with BBarolo, generate mass models, and derive a dark matter halo mass. While the number of galaxies detected in this relatively short pointing appears to be at the high end of expectations compared to other MeerKAT observations and group HI mass function studies, this finding highlights the capability of MeerKAT for other serendipitous discoveries, and the potential for many more HI-rich galaxies to be revealed within both existing and upcoming Open Time data sets.
